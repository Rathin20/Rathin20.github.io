## Biography
I am currently a research intern at National University of Singapore working with Prof. Arnab Bhattacharyya and Prof. Ioannis Panageas.
Before that, I was an intern at Microsoft Research India with Dr. Amit Sharma. I completed my undergraduate at Univ. of Pune, majoring in Computer Engineering.
I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am interested in developing algorithms for learning Probability structures based on the techniques used in analysis of boolean functions and Computational complexity theory in constrained settings.

**Interests. Computational Learning Theory, High-Dimensional Probability, Analysis of Boolean Functions**
