## Introduction
I am currently a research intern at National University of Singapore working with Prof. Arnab Bhattacharyya and Prof. Ioannis Panageas.

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. Specifically, I am interested in developing algorithms for learning Probability structures based on the techniques used in analysis of boolean functions and Computational complexity theory in constrained settings.
